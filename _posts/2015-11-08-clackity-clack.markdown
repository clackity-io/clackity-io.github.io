excerpt: So I'm writing again. Hopefully for longer than a week.

The first thing I did after registering this website's domain name (for the
second(!) time) was to add it to the [HSTS preload list][preload]. That says
something about me, I'm sure.

I think I know some things about security on the internet. I say "on the
internet", but of course I mean something narrower than that. I know nothing
useful about you as a user _being_ secure on the internet. I only know about
the things that web developers can do (or, more likely, not do) to protect you
and your data from the variously nefarious ways in which it can be exfiltrated
out from under you. Most of the time when I write, I'm writing an email about
these kinds of things. Or I'm writing something in hopefully comprehensible
language in a specification document about these kinds of things. Or I'm writing
code that implements something I wrote in an email or specification (though,
really, that's becoming more rare than I'd like).

Writing is pretty much all I do these days, but I've somehow backed myself into
a corner. If I'm not writing a specification that describes a feature that will
have an impact on millions of developers, or writing code that implements such
a feature, then I'm wasting my time. This means that I'm not writing _anything_
unless it's _important_. The woeful state of <https://mikewest.org> is one
result. The absolute lack of anything other than standards activity on
<https://github.com/mikewest> is another.

Both are a shame, because I actually [kinda like writing][clackity].

So, I've decided to give myself permission to goof off a little bit. Maybe I'll
still use the time to write about security things. Maybe I'll write about
Destiny instead, since that's where my non-family free time seems to be going
these days. Maybe I'll write about my daughters, who are amazing. Who knows?

What I do know is that I've missed this: Hello again, Internets. Let's see
where we can wander together.
