Merlin Mann's "[Making the Clackity Noise][clackity]" is inspirational. This is
the second(!) time that I've registered `clackity.io`, and though I'm not at
all sure that I'll do anything with it this time around, if I do, it's at least
partially Merlin's fault.

I have vague ideas about what I'd like to do with this site, but nothing solid
yet. Basically, I've noticed that I write a _lot_ of email, and write a _lot_
of spec text, but practically nothing that lives outside of either of those
worlds. I hope this will give me a place for the kinds of things that I don't
typically write down anywhere else. Let's see how it goes.

PS: The theme is <a href="http://muan.co/">Mu-An</a>'s excellent
<a href='https://github.com/muan/scribble'>Scribble</a> which I've poked at in
various ham-fisted ways to remove some of the things I didn't need.
